  "summary": "The diff correctly updates the hardcoded admin credentials in the backend (backend/main.mo) to username 'Azadnexus.global@gmail.com' and password 'Karusu_7'. The validateAdmin function returns a valid session access key on success and null on failure, satisfying REQ-1. A migration module is also added. The frontend login page behavior cannot be verified from the diff, but the backend changes are consistent with supporting the /admin/login flow.",
