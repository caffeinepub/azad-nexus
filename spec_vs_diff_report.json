  "summary": "The diff implements most of the required features: public website pages (Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact), admin panel with login, inquiry management, blog post management, services management, and a premium visual theme. However, the admin credential storage security is questionable — the backend stores what appears to be a hardcoded hash string as a Motoko let constant rather than using a proper hashing function at runtime. A 'Clear All' inquiries bulk-delete feature was also added without being requested, as were a WhatsApp floating button and individual blog post detail pages.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Admin credentials must be stored securely in the backend — hashed, never in plaintext",
      "reason": "In backend/main.mo, adminPasswordHash is stored as a plain Motoko string literal. There is no evidence of a proper hashing function being applied at runtime; the value is a hardcoded constant. The comment explicitly says 'Passwords are not needed in the backend as authorized users have already entered correct passwords', suggesting password verification logic may not be properly implemented with secure hashing.",
