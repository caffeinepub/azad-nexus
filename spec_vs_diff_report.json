  "summary": "Both REQ-1 and REQ-2 are substantially implemented. The backend exposes an authenticateAdmin function with hardcoded credentials, and the frontend Admin page replaces Internet Identity with a username/password login form including error display and logout. However, the backend function name differs from the AC spec (authenticateAdmin vs adminLogin), and the function uses Runtime.trap instead of returning an error result for invalid credentials, which deviates from the AC requirement of returning an error result rather than trapping.",
